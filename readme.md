### My answer about the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?
   answer: getElementById returns single element
           getElementsByClassName returns html collection
           querySelector returns first matching element  
2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?
   answer: create and insert a new element into the DOMt, we use document.createElement() and                then attach it with appendChild .
3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
   answer: If an event happens on a child element, it bubbles up,that is event bubbling.
           It triggers handlers on its parent.
4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
   answer: Adding one event listener to a parent element and letting events from children bubble             up to it,is event delegation.
            It Saves memory and works even if new child elements are added dynamically.
5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
    answer: preventDefault() stops the default browser action.
            stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling to parent elements
